# SHIFT (304)

> I just tried to download this flag, but it looks like the image got messed up in transit...

# Solution

At first glance, the [image](./SHIFT.png) was heavily distorted. 

![Image of flag](https://github.com/bombunx/CTFs/blob/master/utctf-d4ddy_p0k0_p4nts/Forensics/SHIFT/Flag.pptx)

We obtained the flag by spreading the image in a PowerPoint slide. 

Flag: `utflag{not_when_i_shift_into_maximum_overdrive}`
