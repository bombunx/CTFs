# Solution
This challenge requires bruteforcing technique with Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

Solution is to build a script that can retrieve the Captcha from the webpage, process it and submit back to the server. Solution provided in captcha1.py. The OCR is not very accurate with less than 50% success rate but it still does the job.

Cookie value is important to bypass the brute forcing mechanism.
