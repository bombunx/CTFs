# Captcha 2 | The Missing Lake (350)
```
Sorry for bothering you again! We forgot to retrieve some valuable assets the last time. They have changed their captcha system, I think they know that we know about OCRs :)
```

# Solution
It's easier than the Captcha 1. Since the image are static resources on the server, individually mapping each image to the animal name could be done. The brute force script from Captcha 1 can also be used here.
