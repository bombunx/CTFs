# Solution

As the name of the challenge implies, the flag is encoded using Emojis.
We know that the flag starts with "utflag{" so by matching the letters to the corresponding emojis would give us the flag.
To get the flag, the first letter of the subject the emojis represent are used.

E.g.

  Umbrella = u
  
  Turkey = t
  
  Fire = f
  .
  .
  .




Flag: `utflag{emojis_be_versatile}`
